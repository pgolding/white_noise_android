# White Noise (Android experiment)

This is a native Android port of my [White Noise experiments](https://github.com/pgolding/white_noise) with metaphorical sine-wave rendering of digital art.

The original project can be found here.

Some of the content here is original artwork (of MLK) by Axiom of Choice network artist Alberto Glia.

My goal is to port this to a native Shader at some point and run it on the [Open Frame platform](https://openframe.io/) having built a custom display for my home.
